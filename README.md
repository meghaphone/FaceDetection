# FaceDetection
Following the workshop demo about how to perform face detection using Vision, complete this sample app to have it working for you locally :rocket:

Boilerplate code is provided to help with getting the image from the camera roll, translating between Vision and UIKit coordinate systems, etc
...so you can focus on becoming familiar with Vision's face detection capability!

## Instructions
Starting in the `ViewController`'s `detectFaces` function, fill in the necessary code to perform the 3 steps listed in comments.
1. Ask - initiate Vision request
2. Machinery - perform Vision task
3. Results - do something with Vision's results
